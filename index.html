                <p>
                    Hi. I'm Jeff. I am interested in how humans use computers,
                    and the interfaces between them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been working in this area for about 30 years, prior
                    to the general availability of the World Wide Web. Since
                    those early days, I have worked as an interface designer,
                    graphic artist, illustrator, web developer, software
                    engineer, and user experience designer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much of this work has revolved around the Web, though this
                    is not by any means my sole interest. For the last several
                    years I have been working in the machine learning / AI
                    space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One question I have been asking since I become involved with
                    AI is, "What is the user interface for AI?". With the advent
                    of Large Language Models, this question has become even more
                    critical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a world of Generative AI, how will humans interact with
                    systems that become more and more inscrutable? How do we
                    design systems that produce good outcomes when the
                    underlying system is largely non-deterministic? These are
                    the questions on my mind lately.
                </p>
                <p>Oh, I also like music a lot.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="about" class="sub-panel hidden">
                <h2>
                    What is this all about?
                    <span class="close" id="close-about"></span>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What you see happening on this page started out as a doodle,
                    initially inspired by abstract works by artists such as
                    <a
                        href="https://diebenkorn.org/collections/6673/objects/"
                        target="_blank"
                        >Richard Diebenkorn</a
                    >. The doodle evolved over time into a kind of grid, dancing
                    in my mind between the abstract and the concrete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I became curious if I could write an algorithm to generate
                    variants on the design. Something perhaps similar to
                    <a
                        href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rule110.html"
                        target="_blank"
                        >cellular automata</a
                    >, but turned on its head. Instead of writing an algorithm
                    to see what it would produce, I started with an idea of what
                    I wanted the end product to look like, and crafted my
                    algorithm to produce something akin to that. That idea
                    evolved in to what you see creating and destroying itself
                    here. With some relatively simple rules for generating the
                    design, and then deconstructing it, the system will
                    endlessly explore these ideas of abstraction.
                    <a
                        href="https://github.com/jefffohl/website"
                        target="_blank"
                        >You can see the code here.</a
                    >
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I find fascinating here is how our minds will look at
                    this random arrangement of rectangles and inevitably attempt
                    to identify it, to classify it. Is it a landscape? An aerial
                    view of farmland? A slice of metamorphic schist? What I find
                    interesting is that what our minds do here seems to be
                    similar to the behavior of neural nets. Does this mean that
                    these algorithms are getting closer to the way our own minds
                    process information and perceive the world? I don't really
                    know. But it is an interesting question.
