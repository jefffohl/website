                    I am a product designer, software developer, user experience
                    designer, and visual designer with more than 30 years of
                    experience. I combine technical and creative ability with
                    strategic vision, and possess the ability to lead both
                    creative and technical teams, as well as deliver high
                    quality work as an individual contributor in both the design
                    and engineering realms.

                    I have been involved in the artificial intelligence space
                    for the last decade, and I am interested in how this rapidly
                    advancing technology can be used by creatives and
                    professionals to enhance rather than replace their work.
