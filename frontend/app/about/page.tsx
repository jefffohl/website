                    Hi. I&apos;m Jeff. I am interested in how humans use
                    computers, and the interfaces between them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a product designer, software developer, user experience
                    designer, and visual designer with more than 30 years of
                    experience as a practioner and leader in these fields. For
                    the last decade, I have been working in the machine learning
                    / AI space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One question I have been asking since I become involved with
                    AI is, &ldquo;What is the appropriate user experience for
                    AI?&rdquo;. With the advent of Generative AI, and Large
                    Language Models, this question has become even more
                    critical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a world of Generative AI, how will humans interact with
                    systems that become more and more inscrutable? How do we
                    design systems that produce good outcomes when the
                    underlying system is largely non-deterministic? These are
                    the questions on my mind lately.
                </p>
